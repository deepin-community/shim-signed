shim-signed (1.36) unstable; urgency=medium

    return errors. Closes: #988114
  * Update build-dep on shim-unsigned to use 15.4-5

shim-signed (1.35) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add explicit dependency from shim-signed to shim-signed-common.
    Also check if we have update-secureboot-policy available before we
    try to call it. Closes: #988047, #988056
  * If we're not running on an EFI system then exit cleanly in
    postinst and postrm. We have nothing to do here. Closes: #988059
  * Fix the old doc links for shim-signed. Closes: #988057
  * Update build-dep on shim-unsigned

shim-signed (1.34) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Build against new signed binaries corresponding to 15.4-2
    Closes: #971129, #987991
  * ***WARNING***: arm64 shim is no longer signed, due to major
    toolchain problems. See NEWS.Debian for more
    information. Separated out the binary package for arm64 to allow
    for a different description, and tweaked the Makefile too.
  * Update build-deps and Standards-Version
  * Tweak Makefile setup - do our verification testing chained from
    the "all" target, not "clean". Closes: #936002
  * Don't include apport stuff in the Debian build, it's not useful.
  * Tweak dh_install* usage for docs.
  * Add Spanish translation for debconf templates, thanks to
    Camale√≥n. Closes: #987339
  * Multiple bugfixes in postinst and postrm handling:
    + Call grub-install using the correct grub target in postinst
    + Also call grub-install using the correct grub target in the
      postrm, and clean up the shim binary from the ESP
    + In each case, also check and use the correct configured options
      for grub-install
    + Move the postinst grub-install code from the -common package to
      the arch-specific packages, to make sure it's always called when
      needed.
    + Only run grub-install etc. if we're actually on an EFI-booted
      system.

    15+1533136590.3beb971-7
  * Update Build-Depends and Depends to match. Closes: #928107
  * Drop the hard-coded version in Built-Using; pick up the version of
    shim we're using properly.
  * Display the sha256sums of the binaries as we check them

 -- Steve McIntyre <93sam@debian.org>  Sun, 09 Jun 2019 17:32:54 +0100

shim-signed (1.32) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add Breaks/Replaces to shim-signed-common for
    update-secureboot-policy etc. Closes: #929673

shim-signed (1.31) unstable; urgency=medium

  * update-secureboot-policy: fix error if /var/lib/dkms does not
    exist. Closes: #923718
  * Separate the helper scripts into a new shim-signed-common package,
    apart from the actual signed shim binaries so that we can
    sensibly support co-installability using Multi-Arch.
    Closes: #928486
  * Add/update translations:
    + Italian (Closes: #915993, thanks to Beatrice Torracca)
    + Swedish (Closes: #921410, thanks to Matrin Bagge)

  * Remove doc link used to quieten old lintian versions

 -- Steve McIntyre <93sam@debian.org>  Mon, 27 May 2019 23:02:10 +0100

shim-signed (1.30) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Force the built-using version to be 15+1533136590.3beb971-6. That
    *does* match the source we've used, we're only using -5 due to
    toolchain changes elsewhere. Ick :-(

 -- Steve McIntyre <93sam@debian.org>  Tue, 23 Apr 2019 00:01:10 +0100

shim-signed (1.29) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New signed binaries available from MS for amd64, arm64 and i386
  * Change maintainer to be the EFI team
  * Update the build-depends
    + Specifically depend on sbsigntool (>= 0.9.2-2) to fix a bug in the
      PE/COFF checksum that otherwise breaks the build
  * Tweak the binary package setup a lot
    + We're now building for 3 arches
    + Depend on the right grub-efi-$arch-bin package for each arch
    + Depend on the right shim-helpers-$arch-signed package for each
      arch
    + Remove the old Replaces: and Breaks:, as we don't clash with files
      from the shim binary package any more.
  * Stop copying helper binaries into our package now
    + We just depend on shim-helpers-ARCH-signed now
  * Tweak build, don't assume amd64
  * Add lintian overrides for things we can't really change:
    + We're including pre-built binaries, as that's where our signatures
      are coming from. We have the matching source in the shim source
      package.
  * Update Standards-Version to 4.3.0 (no changes needed)

shim-signed (1.28+nmu3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * (Still) explicitly uploading from a chroot with older binaries
    installed for shim and sbsigntool, and update Build-Depends to
    point to those speficic versions. This package will *not* function
    with other versions installed.
  * Add Breaks: shim (<= 0.9+1474479173.6c180c6-1), Closes: #924100
  * +nmu2 fixed the installability problem caused by waiting for
    Microsoft's signature on the new shim packages. Closes: #922179

 -- Steve McIntyre <93sam@debian.org>  Sat, 09 Mar 2019 23:52:41 +0000

shim-signed (1.28+nmu2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Copy the helper binaries from the shim binary so that we no longer
    need to depend on it. See #922179 for more details. Add a Replaces:
    shim and to allow us to over-write binaries there.
  * Explicitly uploading in a chroot with older binaries installed for
    shim and sbsigntool, and update Build-Depends to point to those
    speficic versions. This package will *not* function with other
    versions installed.
